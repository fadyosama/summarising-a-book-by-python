The Lion 
and the Rabbit
A cruel lion lived in the forest. Every day, he killed and ate a lot of animals. 
The other animals were afraid the lion would kill them all.
The animals told the lion, “Let’s make a deal. If you promise to eat only one 
animal each day, then one of us will come to you every day. Then you don’t have 
to hunt and kill us.”
The plan sounded well thought-out to the lion, so he 
agreed, but he also said, “If you don’t come every day,
I promise to kill all of you the next day!”
Each day after that, one animal went to the lion so 
that the lion could eat it. Then, all the other animals 
were safe.
Finally, it was the rabbit’s turn to go to the lion.
The rabbit went very slowly that day, so the lion 
was angry when the rabbit finally arrived.
The lion angrily asked the rabbit, “Why are 
you late?”
“I was hiding from another lion in the 
forest. That lion said he was the king, so I 
was afraid.”
The lion told the rabbit, “I am the only king 
here! Take me to 
that other lion, 
and I will kill him.
The rabbit replied, “I will be happy 
to show you where he lives.”
The rabbit led the lion to an old well in the middle 
of the forest. The well was very deep with water at the 
bottom. The rabbit told the lion, “Look in there. The lion 
lives at the bottom.”
When the lion looked in the well, he could see his 
own face in-the water. He thought that was the other lion. 
Without waiting another moment, the lion jumped into 
the well to attack the other lion. He never came out.
All of the other ammal^Ln theiorest-were very pleased
with the rabbit’s clevpriirick.

The Laboratory

always closed and locked the door when he went in. She knew that he used it to 
do projects for work. He never told Mia what these projects were.
One night, Mia approached the door to the laboratory. She stopped and 
thought, “I wonder what crazy experiment he is doing now.” Suddenly, she 
heard a loud noise. It sounded like an evil laugh. The noise scared her, so she 
walked quickly back to her room.
The next night, her friend Liz came to her house. When Liz arrived, Mia told 
her about the night before. “Oh, it was terrible,” she said.
“Why don’t we see what is in there?” Liz asked. “It will be a fun adventure!” 
Mia felt nervous about going into her father’s laboratory, but she agreed. As 
always, the door was locked. They waited until Mia’s father left the laboratory to 
eat dinner. “He didn’t lock the door!” Liz said. “Let’s go.”
The laboratory was dark. The girls walked down the stairs carefully. Mia 
smelled strange chemicals. What terrible thing was her father creating?
Suddenly, they heard an evil laugh. It was even worse than the one Mia 
heard the night before. What if a monster was going to kill them? Mia had to do 
something. She shouted for help.
Mia’s father ran into the room and turned on the lights. 
“Oh, no,” he said. “You must have learned my secret.” 
“Your monster tried to kill us,” Mia said.
“Monster?” he asked. “You mean this?” He had a 
pretty doll in his hands. The doll laughed. The laugh 
didn’t sound so evil anymore. “I made this foryour 
birthday. I wanted to give it to you then, but you 
it now. I hope you like it!”

The Report
Lee sat among the books at the library and thought about his group project.
They had to turn it in soon, but he hadn’t even started his part! Jack and Claire 
were in his group. They had worked hard. They were also very smart, and Lee 
didn’t want them to get a bad grade.
Jack did the report. He wrote a lot of very good sentences and described things 
with great adjectives. Claire drew a nice map of the stars. Now, Lee needed to do 
his part of the project.
“Well, I suppose I need to start my model,” Lee thought.
Making a model of a planet was really hard. Lee tried to read several books, 
but he couldn’t comprehend any of the charts. “We’re going to fail because of 
me!” Lee said. He put his head down on the table and said, “I wish I could see a 
planet, instead of having to read about it!”
Suddenly, there was a bright light. Lee was pulled from his chair, through the 
roof, and right into a strange ship! “Hello, kid,” said an alien. “Did you ask for 
help?”
Lee told the friendly alien all about his project. The alien agreed to help Lee 
solve his problem. “First, we’ll fly through space to view the universe. Then, I can 
help you make a model of my planet.”
Soon, they were going through the clouds. They passed the moon. Then they 
viewed Mars. Lee was very excited. Instead of a bad grade, his group would have 
the best project ever!
“It’s time to go home,” the alien finally said. On the way back, he helped Lee 
make a model of the planet 
Mars. Soon, they were on 
Earth.
“Thanks,” Lee said.
“My model will be 
awesome!” Then he 
took his model and 
said goodbye to his 
new friend.

John’s friend came to talk to him about the issue. During their important 
meeting, his friend said, “The people in the village asked me to represent them. 
We want your dog to stop this habit. Why don’t you put a bell around the dog’s 
neck? This way, we would hear your dog coming down the street.”
John thought this was a great idea. Now, people could stay away from the dog. 
It would not be able to bite anyone anymore.
The dog liked the bell, too. People looked at him when they heard his bell. This 
made the dog very content. He liked the song the bell played when he walked. 
One day, John’s dog strolled through the village and met some other dogs. He
expected them to want a bell like his. But they 
laughed at his bell. They said the bell made 
people avoid him. John’s dog shook his head. 
“No, they look at me because they like the 
bell.”
The other dogs said, “You have the wrong 
idea of what makes you popular. Of course 
they like your bell. It tells them where you are 
so they can avoid you. You aren’t able to bite 
them anymore!”
You see, being popular isn’t something 
positive when it’s for the wrong reason.

The Jackal 
and the Sun Child
A jackal is a wild dog with a big black back. It resides in the desert. But how 
did the jackal get his black back? This was how it happened.
One day, the jackal saw a girl. She was sitting upon a rock. She was not a 
normal child. She was a rare and beautiful sun child. She was bright and warm 
like the sun. The child saw the jackal and smiled.
She said, “Jackal, I have been relaxing on this rock for too long. I must get 
home soon. But, I am slow and you are fast. You will likely get me home more 
quickly.” Then she requested, “Will you carry me home? If you do, I’ll give you a 
gift. This necklace belongs to me, but I will give it to you.”
The wild jackal agreed. So the sun child sat on the dog’s back. They started 
to walk. But soon, the jackal felt ill. The sun child was very hot on his back. The 
heat was hurting his back very badly. “I made a terrible error in judgment.” he 
thought. He shouldn’t have agreed to carry her. So he asked her to get off.
But she did not. The jackal’s back continued to get hotter and hotter. He had to 
get away from the sun child. So he made a plan. First, he ran as fast as he could. 
He hoped the sun child would fall off. But she did not. So when the 
sun child was looking at the sky, not aware of the jackal’s next plan, 
he jumped into a field of flowers. As a result, the child rolled off his 
back. The jackal ran away.
But the sun child left a mark on the jackal’s back, a visible 
black mark. Ever since his experience with the sun child, the 
jackal has had a black back.

The Best Prince
King Minos was very sick. His condition was getting worse. He had three sons. 
He loved them all. He had to announce who would become king.
Two of the princes stood waiting outside the king’s room. Theseus was the 
oldest and strongest. He thought his father would make him king. Pelias, the 
second son, thought differently. He was an expert with weapons. He thought the 
king would choose him.
“When I’m king,” Theseus told Pelias, “I’ll let you contribute to the defense of 
our country. You can lead the army.”
Pelias became angry. “Father knows I’m famous for my sword skills. He’ll make 
me king.”
“You?” Theseus yelled. “He won’t choose you!”
“The kingdom is mine!” Pelias claimed. “Father will give it to me—or I’ll use 
force to take it!”
Theseus made a sudden move to take out his sword. Then Pelias did the same.
“Beating me will be a challenge,” Theseus said. “Fight me now. The 
winner gets the kingdom!”
Pelias agreed.
King Minos could hear his sons fighting. The youngest son, Jason, 
stood beside him. He sensed his father’s sadness. The king laid his 
hand flat on Jason’s arm.
“Your brothers fight too much,” the king told him. “I must 
protect my kingdom from all harm. They’ll divide it between 
them. The people won’t know what to do. There’ll be war. I can’t 
allow either of them to be king. Therefore, I’m making you king. 
Your kindness has always made you special. It’s the difference 
between you and your brothers. You can bring peace. They 
can’t.”
Then the king died. Theseus and 
Pelias heard that their youngest 
brother was king. They were surprised.
They realized that their fighting was 
wrong. It had kept them from saying 
goodbye to their father. They agreed to 
have Jason as their king. He was the 
best choice. rp

How the Sun and 
the Moon Were Made
Do you ever wonder where the moon and the sun came from? The Inuit people 
of Alaska have a theory.
They tell a story about a beautiful girl. She was very nice. In contrast, her brother 
was a mean little boy. One day he proposed something. “We should go to a party,” 
he said. The girl accepted. First, it was necessary for her to prepare. She arranged 
her hair and put on nice clothes. This required a lot of time. But the girl worked hard, 
and soon she had success. She looked perfect.
They attended the party together. The girl was having fun. Later, she walked 
into the bathroom. Suddenly, the lights were turned off! Someone grabbed her 
hair and tore her clothes. She ran out of the bathroom. She wanted to know who 
did this to her.
Then she had an idea. She fixed her hair again. This time it was even more 
beautiful. She even balanced beautiful jewels in it. She wanted to encourage the 
person to grab it again. She put black dirt in her hair. The purpose of this was to 
catch the person.
She went to the bathroom again, and it 
was the same pattern. The lights went 
off, and someone grabbed her hair.
When he released it, his hand 
was black. The girl returned to the 
party. She knew there was only a 
single person with a black hand.
When she saw that person, he 
was very familiar. It was her 
brother!
He ran into the woods.
The girl ran after him. They 
both carried fire so they could 
see in the dark. The smoke 
went into the air. As they ran, 
they grew. They became huge.
Then they went into space. When 
the girl’s fire went out, she hung 
in the sky. She became the moon, 
and her brother became the sun. They 
chase each other forever.

The Starfish
Last summer I took a trip to an island. I had a lot of fun. I sat and watched the 
waves and listened to the ocean. I learned to identify birds. I discovered pretty 
things and enjoyed the taste of new foods. It was a very nice time.
One evening I took a pleasant walk by the ocean. When the waves came in, 
many starfish* fell on the beach. Some starfish went back into the water, and 
they were safe. But other starfish were still on the sand. They would die if they 
did not get into the water. There were many starfish on the beach that night. It 
made me sad, but I knew I could not fix the problem. I stepped very carefully so 
I did not damage them.
Then I saw a little girl. She was also sad about the starfish. She wanted to 
prevent all of them from dying. She asked me if I could perhaps help her.
“To be frank, I don’t think we can do anything,” I said.
The little girl started to cry. She sat back against a rock and thought for a 
while. Finally, the emotion was gone. She stopped crying and stood up. Then 
she picked up a starfish and threw it into the water.
“What are you doing?” I asked her. But she did not answer me. She just threw 
as many starfish as she could. “You cannot save all of them!” I said.
She stopped to look at me. “No, I cannot save them all,” she replied. Then 
she picked up a very big starfish and said, “But I can save 
this one.” And then she smiled and threw the starfish as 
far as she could into the ocean.

The First Peacock
Argos lived in Ancient Greece. He was a husband and a proud father. He 
worked hard and did well at his job. But one thing about him wasn’t normal. He 
was born with 100 eyes. Having many eyes was usually a benefit to him. He had 
a chance to see many things.
Also, since he had so many eyes, he was very good at guarding things. While 
sleeping, he only rested a few eyes at a time. The others stayed awake. He worked 
for Hera, a great goddess. His primary function was to guard a special cow. The 
cow was very important to Hera. It was her favorite pet. The most essential part 
of his job was to keep the cow alone. It had to be kept separate from all the other 
cows and far away from people.
This was an easy job for Argos. The cow just ate grass all day. But the god Zeus 
wanted the cow. He wanted to take it away from Hera. He had a plan. He found a 
great music player. He asked the man to play a beautiful song for Argos. Zeus was 
certain Argos would go to sleep.
The song had an immediate effect. Argos couldn’t focus on his job. He fell 
asleep. Zeus saw this, and he took the cow.
Hera was very angry with Argos. She turned him into a peacock. She put his 
many eyes on his tail. Argos was very sad.
Zeus saw how much trouble he had 
caused Argos. He made another 
plan. He turned Argos into a 
group of stars. He wanted 
Argos to remain in the 
sky forever. Even today,

there, above the 
site where all his 
problems began.

Princess Rose 
and the Creature
There was once a beautiful princess named Rose. Her mother, the queen, 
however, was not as beautiful as the princess. The queen felt bad that she was not 
the most beautiful woman in the kingdom anymore. She was tired of competing 
with her daughter. She made a decision. She prepared a drink for the princess. 
After the princess drank it, she fell asleep. Then the queen took the princess to 
the forest. She left the princess there. It was a very serious thing to do. “Either 
she will be killed by animals or she will get lost in the forest,” the queen thought.
The princess had a dream. She dreamed about a man with brown hair and 
brown eyes. It was the man she would wed.
The princess woke up. She saw a strange creature on the ground. It looked like 
a man, but he was hairy and green. He had horns on his head and a pig’s nose.
The creature said, “Did I scare you? I hope not. Let me introduce myself. I am 
Henry.”
“I am not scared. To tell you the truth, I think you are cute,” said Rose.
Rose and Henry spent the day together. They collected 
berries, caught fish, and had lunch. They had a very good day 
filled with nice conversations.
“Rose, I have to go home,” said Henry. “My ship will sail 
home soon. I can’t leave you here in the forest alone. Will you 
come with me?”
Rose was very happy. She gave Henry a kiss right on his pig 
nose. As soon as she kissed Henry, he began 
to change. His pig nose turned into a man’s 
nose. His horns and green hair went away.
Standing in front of her was the man Rose 
had dreamt about.
Rose and Henry were married, and 
they lived happily.

The Crazy Artist
Frenhoferwas the best artist in the world. Everyone loved him. The quality 
of his paintings was very high. He always used the best materials. He made a 
big profit from his paintings. He had delicious meals with his rich neighbors. He 
taught art classes. Life was good.
Then his attitude changed. He stopped selling paintings and teaching. He tried 
a new method of painting. He stayed alone in his apartment all day. He worked 
all day and all night, rarely eating. Soon Frenhofer became very thin. But he kept 
working on the same painting for many years. He worked as hard as he could.
Finally, he finished the painting. He was very happy and invited other artists 
to see it. “I want your professional opinion,” he said. He wanted them to judge 
it and compare it to other paintings. Everyone was very excited as they went up 
the stairs to his apartment. Frenhofer was excited to show his painting, and the 
artists were excited to see it. “They’ll love it,” he thought. But they did not.
They were surprised by his painting. There was no white anywhere. Frenhofer 
filled the whole painting with lines and colors. There was no space for a normal 
picture. It was full of strange shapes. It looked bad to the other artists. He used 
symbols, and they didn’t understand them. They thought it was terrible. “Why 
did you paint this strange picture?” someone asked. They didn’t understand its 
beauty.
But after some time, many people began to like his painting. People wrote 
articles about it in magazines. They said it was 
his best work. They loved his strange 
symbols. They loved 
his strange colors.
Frenhofer’s painting 
reminded everyone that 
just because something 
was new didn’t mean 
that it was bad. He also 
helped them to realize 
that sometimes it takes 
people a little time 
to understand great 
things.

The Farmer 
and the Cats
Arthur was a responsible farmer, and Maria was a nice lady. But they were poor. 
They owed the town lord money for their land. One summer, their farm burned. 
One structure caught fire, and most of the animals ran away. Only the cats stayed. 
So Arthur and Maria had to bring in their crops without an animal’s help.
On a fall day, the lord demanded his money. Arthur asked if the lord could wait 
until he brought in his crops.
The lord was angry. He raised his hands high and yelled, “Pay me by the end 
of the week. If you don’t, I will increase the money you have to pay. I might put 
you in a jail cell.”
So Arthur and Maria worked until there was blood on their hands. They finished 
four lines of corn and went to bed.
But the next morning, eight lines were finished! “Maria, didn’t we stop in this 
spot here?” Arthur asked.
“Yes, that is correct. And the tools were in a different position, too,” Maria 
said. They were surprised and happy. That day, they worked hard and finished 
five lines.
But in the morning, ten lines were done! Each day they did a lot of work. Each 
night, someone else did an equal amount of work. In a week, the whole field was 
finished. “Tomorrow I will sell the crops and pay the lord,” Arthur said. But that 
morning, the crops were gone. A bag was in the middle of the field. It contained 
money.
“Maria, let’s see who has helped us work.” Through a hole in the wall, they 
saw a funny sight. The cats were dancing in the field and eating corn! Now Arthur 
knew what had happened. The cats had worked at night! After that, Arthur was 
very nice to his cats and fed them lots of corn.

The Big Race
A dog saw a group of animals across the road. He walked over to meet them.
“What are you doing?” he asked them.
“I just sold them tickets to a race between the rabbit and the turtle,” the duck 
responded.
This news excited the dog. He felt fortunate that he happened to be there. “I 
don’t have anything to do today,” the dog said. “I want to buy a ticket, too.”
The dog sat down to observe the race. The race would be extreme. It would be 
many kilometers in length. The rabbit and the turtle stood next to each other. 
They waited for the race to start. The dog wondered why the turtle agreed to run 
against the rabbit. Being fast was not a characteristic of turtles. The rabbit was 
going to win easily.
Suddenly, the race began. The rabbit ran extremely quickly. The turtle walked 
slowly. After a minute, the rabbit looked back. He saw that the turtle was far 
behind him and was breathing quickly because he was so tired. The rabbit 
smiled and slowed to a walk.
A minute later, the rabbit said, “I’m winning, so I’ll take a rest.” He sat and 
began to consume some grass. Then, he let his eyes close. He wasn’t the winner 
yet. But there was no risk of him losing the race. He went to sleep.
Hours later, a loud sound woke him. All of the animals were yelling and looking 
at the field. He felt fear for the first time. The turtle was almost at the finish line. 
Now, the rabbit realized his mistake. But the race was over. He gave the turtle an
opportunity to win, and the turtle took it. The duck handed 
the turtle his prize. It was the happiest day of the turtle’s life.
The dog was happy for the turtle. “He isn’t fast,” the dog 
thought. “But he tried his best and did 
something great.” FINISH

Adams County’s Gold
Adams Academy was a good school. Boys lived there and took classes. Tom 
worked hard all week. On a spring Saturday, he wanted to do something fun!
He asked his friend Jeff to go to the movie theater. “Sorry,” Jeff answered. “I’m 
going to a concert.”
So Tom asked Joe to go to the movies. But Joe’s soccer team had a game.
Next, Tom went down the hall to Brad’s room. Brad was reading a very large 
old book. “Hi, Brad,” Tom said. “Are you reading a dictionary? It looks ancient.”
“No. This is called The Wealth of Adams County. It’s about hidden gold in 
Adams County. It’s more than a century old. It was published in 1870! Look, it 
even has the original cover on it.”
Tom asked, “Where did you get it?”
“It’s from my dad’s friend. He is a nice gentleman, an officer in the army,” 
answered Brad.
“The gold doesn’t really exist, does it?” Tom asked.
“I don’t know, but maybe! There are clues to it in this book. Let’s find it!” 
Looking for gold sounded like fun.
The first clue was to find a flat tree underground. “It must be in the forest,” 
Tom said.
Brad said, “The flat tree could be a board under the dirt. It could cover the 
gold.”
Tom and Brad dug in the dirt all morning.
The process of looking for gold made them 
hungry. They were ready to stop for lunch.
But then Brad hit something hard. It was a 
board!
Brad pounded on the board until it broke.
There was a small hole under it. “Look!” He 
held up a gold coin.
Tom saw a piece of paper in the hole. “Brad, 
there’s more. It’s a map to the rest of the 
gold!”
Brad smiled. “Let’s go!” And they 
hurried to find the wealth of Adams 
County.
Answer the questions.
1. Where do the boys look for the gold?
a. At Adams Academy
b. At the movie theater
c. In the forest
d. In a concert hall
What is NOT true of The Wealth of Adams County?
a. It was published more than a century ago.
b. It was written by an army officer.
c. It still has its original cover.
d. It tells about a board in the forest floor.
3. Why does Brad think the gold really exists?
a. Because there are clues to it in a book
b. Because a gentleman told him it did
c. Because he was given an ancient dictionary
d. Because it was hidden in the spring
4. Where will the boys probably go at the end of the story?
a. To get tools to carry the gold
b. To continue the process of finding gold
c. To watch Joe’s soccer team
d. To pound on more boards
5. Why can’t Jeff go to the movie theater?

The Race for Water
There was a town next to a river. The people there had a lot of water. But they 
wasted it. That made the Sky angry. It said, “If you waste water, I will take it away 
from you.” But the people didn’t listen.
When the season changed from spring to summer, the clouds disappeared. 
The bright sun was hot and made the river dry. There was no water available. 
People asked, “When will the rain fall?”
The Sky’s response was, “You don’t appreciate water. You waste it, and now I 
will never make rain again.”
A boy determined that this wasn’t fair. He thought of a solution. He asked the 
Sky to race him. He said, “If I get to the top of that hill before your rain can form 
puddles, you must fill our river.”
The Sky laughed. “Little boy, I am the Sky. I am above everything else. You 
cannot beat me.” But the boy knew he would win.
When the race began, the boy ran forward. The Sky started raining on the hill. 
But puddles did not form there. When it rained on the hill, the water went down.
The Sky kept raining. The water flowed down into the river. When the boy 
reached the top of the hill, the river was full. The people began to celebrate. It 
was the highest level the river had ever been at before.
The Sky was angry. “A boy can’t beat me! I won’t fill your river,” it said.
Now the boy laughed. “It doesn’t matter whether you want to fill it or not,” he 
said. “You already did.” The Sky looked at the full river.
“You tricked me,” it said. It asked the people, “Do 
you appreciate water now?”
“Yes,” they said. “We won’t waste it.”
That is how a lone boy saved his town and won the 
race for water.

to people in the town. The people loved her products.
One day, a cat came to her property. He saw the sign that indicated where 
the chicken’s store was located. He wanted to purchase bread, but the chicken’s 
store was almost empty. She had only a bag of wheat.*
“You can use the wheat to make bread,” the chicken said.
“No, I don’t want to work,” the cat said. “I just want to buy bread.” The cat 
became angry and left the store.
Later, the little red chicken saw the cat in a crowd.
“I will help you make the bread,” she said.

to do work for you,” said 
the little red chicken.
“Then how will I get bread?” the cat asked.

The Seven Cities of Gold
Many years ago, a Spanish officer named Coronado heard the story of seven 
great cities. “The walls of these cities are made of gold,” his friends told him. “The 
people eat meat from golden plates and dress in nice clothes,” they said. They 
called these cities the Seven Cities of Gold. Were the cities real? Coronado never 
considered asking his friends.
Coronado thought to himself, “The things in these cities must be worth a lot of 
money.” So he went to find the Seven Cities of Gold. He took along three hundred 
men, many horses, and extra food. They headed west. Coronado wanted to 
achieve his goal very badly.
Coronado and his men rode for many days. Then they saw some cities. “We 
found the Seven Cities of Gold!” his men yelled, but Coronado wasn’t happy. He 
had a different opinion. “These can’t be the Seven Cities of Gold,” he said. “Look, 
they’re made of dirt!”
Coronado was right. The cities weren’t bright and golden. They were dirty and 
brown. The people didn’t eat meat from golden plates. They ate vegetables from 
regular bowls. They wore the most basic clothes.
Coronado regarded the cities as ugly places.
“What happened to the cities of gold?” he thought.
“Did someone destroy them? Was there a war? Did 
someone already come and take the gold?”
That night, the people of the cities entertained 
Coronado and his men and served them food.
They advised Coronado to go home. “There is 
no gold here,” they told him. Coronado was 
id his friends lie to him? 
ft the next morning. He looked back at 
s one more time. The sun reflected light

of gold. Were his friends right after all? “No,”

I first met 8-year-old Katy on a rainy afternoon. I was a nurse at a hospital. The 
clerk at the desk told me about Katy. She was there because she felt a lot of pain. 
The doctors located a problem at the base of her brain. I knew she was special,

Tommy, a little boy. Though Katy did not feel well, she was playing with Tommy 
and his toys. It took a lot of effort for her just to sit in the chair. But she played 
with Tommy because it made him happy.

lie in bed. One day I found her painting a picture. Later, she gave it to one of the 
older patients. Another day she went outside to get flowers for another sick little 
girl. Katy made everyone smile.

successful! The doctors informed the

was fine. She soon felt excellent. She 
got better and was able to leave the 
hospital a month later.

she said. But she still had to play.

you advance to the middle. I will go right. Those two will go left.”

red team player coming. Stacie hid behind a tree and then jumped 
out and shot the other player. “This is fun!” Stacie thought.

red flag. A red team member was watching over it. She shot 
him with her water gun. Then she lowered the flag and ran

A Strong Friendship
Tim was the strongest man in the town. When he played sports, he always 
won. He performed and exercised in the public park. He did this to show 
everyone how strong he was. Most people liked him, but one man didn’t. His 
name was Jack.
Jack hated Tim. Jack was a movie critic and the smartest man in town. He could 
solve complex math problems. But no one cared. Jack wanted to be famous like 
Tim.
One day, there was an unusual event. A big storm came suddenly. Snow 
covered the town. No one could get out. They needed food. The people said, 
“This is a task for a strong man.” Tim was under pressure to save them. But Jack 
wanted to be the hero, so they both went. Tim said, “You can’t help because of 
your lack of strength.”
But Jack found some small passages under the snow. One of them led toward 
another town. That town had food. Because Tim was so big and strong, he almost 
couldn’t fit inside. They walked until there was a block of ice in their way. Jack 
said, “We can’t get past it. But if you strike it, it might break.” Tim knew that was 
probable.
He broke it. When there were more ice blocks, Tim broke them. That made
him tired. He couldn’t walk anymore.
Jack said, “Let’s unite and 
support each other. I’ll get 
the food alone. You rest 
here.”
Jack came back with 
food. Tim couldn’t 
remember which passage 
led home. He needed Jack to 
be his guide. The men became 
friends by working together.
In town, people saw Jack 
with the food and cheered.
They called Jack a hero. But 
Jack didn’t care. He was 
thinking of something 
else. He said to Tim, “I 
thought I was smart, 
but I learned a new term 
today: friendship.”

Joe’s Pond
Joe made the world a better place. He got the idea to do that at school. He 
watched a video there. It was about a factory. This factory produced a lot of 
trash and put it in a river. The trash and water were a bad mix. People populated 
the area by the river and drank its water. This made them sick. Many of them 
needed medicine and made regular visits to doctors.
But the video wasn’t all bad news. It showed ways to pick up trash and 
why it’s important to do this. It said people can make a difference to their 
environment. The video’s important features made Joe associate trash with 
hurting people.
One day Joe walked through a park. He recognized some of the problems 
from the video. One instance of these problems was the trash in the pond. It was 
full of plastic cups. There was too much trash. Joe didn’t want it to hurt anyone.
He told his grandfather about the park. His grandfather said, “You know, it’s 
a tradition in our family to help people. That’s why we give food to poor people. 
Maybe you can help people by cleaning the park.”
Cleaning the park would involve hard work. Joe decided to organize a group 
to help him. He chose a wide area of the park. It had the most trash. He asked 
his family and friends to come. On Saturday, he gave everyone a sharp stick. 
They wondered why. He said, “You use the stick’s tip to pick up trash. This 
makes it easier.” They worked 
for six weeks. Different 
people helped each time, 
but Joe was always there.
In that period of time,
Joe saw a range of results.
There was no trash in the 
water. People could swim 
in it. Joe knew that was a 
good sign. He was happy 
because he helped his 
environment.

Archie and His Donkey
Old Archie needed some money. He decided to sell his donkey. So he and his 
son Tom went to town. It was situated many miles away.
Soon, they met a woman. “Where are you going?” she asked.
“To town,” said Archie.
“Any smart person would ride the donkey,” she said.
“What are you implying?” Archie asked. “I’m very smart!” Archie wanted to 
look smart. So he climbed onto the donkey. Then they continued in the direction 
of the town.
Further along the road, they met a farmer.
“Hello,” said Archie. “We want to sell this donkey. Do you want to buy it?”
“I don’t need a donkey,” said the farmer. “But if you want my advice, don’t ride 
it. The donkey needs to be in good physical condition.”
“Good idea,” said Archie. “Tom, I want you to ride it. You’re lighter.”
“Neither you nor your son should ride it. It looks very tired. You should carry 
the donkey.” suggested the farmer.
“You’re right,” said Archie. “Come on, Tom! We’ll carry it for the final few miles!” 
The donkey was very heavy, and they couldn’t maintain a good speed. They 
didn’t arrive until late in the evening. At last, they walked into the town. But there 
they attracted the attention of some teenage boys. They laughed at Tom and 
Archie. They started to throw stones at them. The donkey reacted by kicking. Tom 
and Archie dropped the donkey. It fell on the ground and then ran 
away. Archie lost his donkey. He went home with no money.

The Spider 
and the Bird
There was once a very big spider. If a bug got into his web, he would examine 
it. However, he didn’t eat the bug right away. He asked the bug a question first. It 
was always quite a difficult puzzle. If the bug’s answer was correct, he let it go. If 
not, he ate it.
One day, a small bird on a journey flew into the spider’s web. The spider 
couldn’t imagine eating a bird. It was so big! But his hunger was too great. He 
said to the bird, “If you cannot give me a specific answer, I will eat you.”
The bird laughed. “I could eat you!” But the bird was actually scared. She had 
used all her energy trying to get out of the web. And a spider’s bite can be very 
effective in killing animals.
“Please don’t eat me,” the bird said. “I would rather make a deal with you.” 
“OK,” the spider said. “If your answer is right, I will let you go. If not, you must 
give me a gift. It must be something of great value.”
The bird said, “You can pick anything you want to eat. I will find it for you.” The 
spider agreed.

The Party
Cody’s family moved to a new house. His dad got a new job as a professor. 
Cody liked his new town, but he missed his grandparents. For his birthday, Cody 
wanted to have a party. His dad said, “Yes, we could even have a band play!”
On the day of the party, Cody woke up and rushed to get ready. He started to 
check his list of things to do. He was so excited! But then he noticed something 
terrible. There was snow on the ground and lots of it! “Dad!” he yelled. “How can 
the band play their instruments outside?”
Dad said, “We’ll move the stage inside.” It barely fit within the garage because 
there were some boxes and garbage there. But when they finished, they got a call 
from the band. They did not want to come in the snow storm.
Dad said, “Let’s get someone to perform magic.” But no one would come 
because of the snow.
Finally, Dad said, “Cody, there’s too much snow. We need to cancel the party.” 
“Yes, sir,” Cody said sadly. “It’s going to be a boring birthday,” he predicted. 
Cody wanted to share his birthday with someone. He wanted to be at his old 
home. He wanted to see his grandparents.
But then something got his attention. He noticed a car in the driveway. His 
grandparents owned a car like that!
Cody was right. His 
grandparents came for his 
birthday! “Happy birthday, Cody!
We’re sorry we are late. But there 
was so much snow. It made us 
go off schedule. We tried to leave 
a message to tell you.”
Cody told them what 
happened. “I’m sorry,” said 
Grandpa.
“I was sad,” Cody said. “But 
I’m not anymore. I’m so happy to 
see you.” Dad brought out Cody’s 
birthday treat. It was his favorite 
type, a sundae with whipped 
cream on top. Then Cody told 
his grandparents about the new 
town. It was his best birthday 
ever.

How the World 
Got Light

importance. He was rich, and he had a lot of strength. But he was mean to all the 
animals in Darkland. He kept all of the world’s light in a bag. He preferred to keep 
the world cool and dark. He wanted to stop the progress of the city. The animals 
couldn’t work in the dark. He didn’t have any respect for them. “Light is too good 
for them,” he said. “Only I should have light.”
But the animals needed light. So they decided to hold a competition. They 
wanted to find the smartest animal in Darkland. That animal had to steal light from 
the president. They advertised the competition everywhere. All the animals came.
The animals all showed off their skills. The audience watched and then voted 
for the animal with the most knowledge. The winner was a tall bird named Raven.

gain light from the president?” thought Raven. He needed to trick the president

i Cats and Secrets
In English, there is a common idiom “let the cat out of the bag.” It means to 
tell a secret. But where did this idiom start?
It came from a section of England. Long ago, people there went from town to 
town to sell things like vegetables, clothes, and pigs. They had strong beliefs 
about honesty. They didn’t like lying. One day, a man went to the section’s center 
to sell things.
“I have a baby pig for sale! It won’t cost much,” he said. He held the animal 
above his head. His style was different from honest people’s style. He was a 
master of tricking people and lying.
A woman named Beth scanned his pig. He offered her the pig for one gold 
coin. That was a very small amount. Beth gave him the coin. He put it 
in his pocket. He walked ahead of Beth to get the pig.
He gave her a closed bag and said, “Here’s your pig.” He then left 
very quickly.
Beth looked at the bag’s surface. It was moving. She opened it 
to let the pig out. A cat was inside! “He tricked me! That isn’t 
proper,” she said.
Later, the man returned to trick more people. Beth saw 
him and the memory of the cat came back. She told her 
friends. They stopped him. But no one knew what to do 
next.
Someone said, “We need an independent and fair 
person to decide that.” They went to the judge. Beth told 
him about the cat in the bag.
The judge asked, “Is there evidence? Can you demonstrate 
how he did it?”
“Look in his bag,” said Beth. She opened it and let a cat 
out of the bag. They learned the man’s secret, and he went to 
jail.
That’s how the idiom “let the cat 
out of the bag” came to 
mean to tell a secret.
1. What is the main idea of this story?
a. It is about a common belief about cats.
b. People should scan evidence carefully.
c. Masters of lying will go to jail.
d. It is about the origin of an idiom.
2. What did Beth say after she was tricked?
a. That’s not proper.
b. That’s a very small amount.
c. Can you demonstrate how he did it?
d. We need an independent and fair person to help.
Answer the questions.
3. Where did the man hold the pig?
a. In a pocket
b. On the surface of the bag
c. Above his head
d. In the section’s center
4. Why did Beth look at the bag?
a. The surface was moving.
b. The man had a different style.
c. The man was ahead of her.
d. He offered the pig for so little money.
5. When did the memory of the cat come back to Beth?
