The Deer and His Image
A deer told himself every day, “I am the most handsome deer in the forest.
My large chest is a symbol of my power. And my beautiful horns impress other 
animals.”
But he did not like his legs and hooves*. “My legs are narrow, and my hooves 
are ugly. They do not satisfy me.”
One day, the deer saw a big dog. The deer made some noise and disturbed 
the dog. The dog woke up and chased him. The deer felt terror. He screamed. He 
did not want to be a victim, so he ran into the forest. His strong legs helped him 
run fast. His pale brown hooves were hard, so they were not sensitive to rough 
rocks. However, his horns got caught in branches, slowing him down. His large 
chest could not fit between thick trees.
The deer estimated that he ran for an hour. He felt like he was running a 
marathon. In the end, the deer escaped the threat of the dog. He sat in the 
shade of a tree. “That was almost a disaster! I almost did not escape because 
of my chest and horns. My legs and hooves saved me.” As a consequence, the 
deer learned to honor his fast legs and have confidence in his strong hooves.

tallest mountain in the world.

and I knew we needed proof of our climb. I took many pictures with my camera. I’ll 
put them in a frame and hang them.

I looked over the side of the mountaintop. From that angle, I saw the border of 
the clouds touch the rocks below. The snow was thick. It looked pure. There was 
no sign of modern life. Thousands of years ago, my ancestors saw the world this 
way.
After fifteen minutes, I knew it was time to proceed down the mountain. The

on a giant pirate ship. On my first night, there was a thick fog over the water. A 
lamp on the ship revealed an enormous man. He had a sword in his belt. His 
name was Blackbeard, and he was one of the most violent pirates ever.

near a town. He took some of the town’s citizens. Then he declared, “You give 
me medicine!” Blackbeard wanted the medicine for some of the sick pirates on 
his ship.
The people had a bad impression of him. They were mad, and they resisted. 
But they were trapped. They wanted to get rid of him. So the town’s council 
decided to give him the medicine.
After this, there was a reward for catching 
Blackbeard. If Blackbeard was caught, he would 
have a trial. He didn’t want to go to jail, so he 
quit being a pirate.

Royal Navy was still looking for him. They

people who came in to eat. He charged too much for meals. Many people were 
not able to afford the cheapest bean dish. When his metal oven broke, he did 
not have it fixed. So everything baked in it burned. The only light was from 
candles, and the whole place was a mess. Sometimes, he didn’t pay his waiters. 
Since they had no funds, they had many debts.

One day, a cat hiked on a mountain. When he reached the peak, he met a fox. 
They began talking about how they get away from their enemies.
“I am very smart. I have billions of ideas. I can carve a tiny hole in a tree, and 
then climb in,” the fox said. He added, “I have a lot of friends. If I am in trouble,
I can call them to lend their help. I can escape an entire army if I have to!”
Then, the fox asked, “What are your potential plans?” The cat said, “I have 
only one plan.” The fox said, “ I hope you have good fortune, then! Do you want 
me to be your tutor? I can teach you many things.” The cat said, “ I guarantee 
that my plan works every time. We can quit talking about it.”
Soon, they saw a group of wolves. It was an emergency. The cat quickly used 
her plan. She ran up a tree. The fox could not decide which plan to use. “What

The Lucky Knife
I’ve devoted my life to studying past generations. Last year, I had a unique 
chance to work with my uncle. Our job was to find old treasures for a school’s 
history foundation. He also hired a crew of students. They signed a contract to 
work with him. He was the boss. The place was strange, though. I dined on many 
things that I had never tasted before. They had an unusual flavor.
We had been there about a month and hadn’t found anything. One day, I 
began to dig in the soil. The ground’s layers got wetter. Soon I was digging in 
the mud. My shovel began to get very heavy. It felt like it had doubled in weight 
because the ground had absorbed a lot of water.
Finally, I saw something in the mud. It was an old knife! The handle felt 
smooth in my hand. I elevated it so I could see it better. There was writing on it.
“It says it will bring good luck,” my uncle said with a smile. “Why don’t you 
keep it?”
I put it in my tent. The next day, we found many more things. There were pots, 
jewelry and weapons. My uncle donated all of the things to a special committee.

good luck!

Prince Sam
Sam’s mother cooked at the royal palace. One day, he went to work with her. 
She emphasized that he should stay in the kitchen. But Sam was bored. Thus, 
he decided to look around.
He went around a corner. It shocked him to see a boy who had a strong 
likeness to him. Sam soon recovered. The other boy stared at him. Then he 
spoke. “Come with me.”
He needed to be rational. But he couldn’t deny that he wanted to go. So he 
followed the boy to a chamber. “ I am Prince Bertram,” the boy said.
Sam felt shy talking to a prince. “I’m Sam.”
“Trade places with me.” The prince said.
“We can’t. My mother will kill me. Moreover, I don’t know anything about 
being a prince.”
“ No one will find out,” the prince interrupted. “We look the same, and even 
our gestures are the same. It will only last for a week.”
Sam said OK. Soon, Sam’s perspective on being a prince changed. He spent 
most of his day signing royal documents. At night, the prince’s chamber was 
cold. He thought he was going to freeze or get sick with a fever or the flu. He was 
happy when the week ended. So was the prince.
“ I didn’t know how to do anything,” the prince said. “ I’ve always relied on my 
servants to do everything for me.”
“ I think I like being a regular person,” Sam said. “Being a prince isn’t fun.” 
So, they both returned to their normal positions and enjoyed their lives more 
than before.

Henry Ford’s Famous Car
My name is Henry Ford, and I invented a car called the Model T. I used to 
watch carriages on the streets. They fascinated me. Then I got a job as a junior 
mechanic. My father criticized me. He wanted me to run the farm. But I did not 
shift my plans.
Then I worked for the Detroit Auto Company. But I wanted to make cars using 
less labor. That way, there would be fewer expenses. I started the Ford Motor 
Company in 1903. At first, the company did not do well. But many people were 
betting on my success. I also had a sincere aim to make a car that anybody 
could buy.
Then, in 1908,1 introduced the Model-T in a formal ceremony. It confirmed 
that I was right: it was possible to build a car my way!
The Model T differed from other vehicles. Workers could attach different parts 
for cars or trucks. This saved time. One Model T could be put together in 93 
minutes. All of them had the same classic design. They were all the same size 
and height. The prime reason for doing this was to save money.
Over 19 years, I sold over 15 million 
Model Ts. This sent a signal 
to other companies.
People would buy cars 
to commute to work 
if the price was low 
enough.

The Priest
A young priest was always sad. He was good at his 
profession, but he still had no joy. He visited a group of 
wise monks.
When he got to the monks’ house, they greeted 
him and let him in. The monks asked the priest,
“What is the matter?” The priest said, “ I should 
be happy, but I am not. I don’t know 
what to do.” The wise monks paused 
for a minute. Then one said, “We 
are convinced of your faith. You are 
a very good priest. But to find joy, 
you have to do more. Above all, 
investigate the elements of your 
life that you love.” The priest 
thought that this answer was 
odd, but he was curious.
The next day, the priest thought 
about his abilities. He got a few 
ideas, and he did not want to delay 
any longer. He liked to draw, so he made 
some cartoons. He also liked to write, so 
he started a diary. He was interested in 
agriculture, so he planted some grains.
He made jam from berries. He made his 
own labels to put on the jars of jam. He 
painted his ceiling. The priest learned 
something. It is not too hard to be 
happy after all. All one has to do is 
find things they like doing, and do 
them!

I Mrs. May
and the Green Girl I
One morning, people from a small town found a little girl by a stream. She 
seemed to be wearing a green costume. As the people got closer, they saw that 
the girl’s skin was green!
“Oh my!” The people exclaimed. “What if her motive for coming to our town 
is bad? What if she has a strange origin?”
An old woman kindly went to her. “Look how scared she is. Please,” she 
begged. “ Do not reject her. I will adopt her.”
There was silence until the judge spoke. “I don’t know,” he said in a worried 
tone. “But we cannot forbid you. I indeed hope you’re not being a fool.”
Mrs. May extended her hand to the girl. “Come 
with me. I won’t hurt you.”
The girl spoke a language Mrs. May didn’t 
know. But she was able to interpret what 
the girl was trying to say. Sometimes the girl 
drew pictures to illustrate what she meant.
The green girl was from a place far 
beyond the sun. There, people lived in 
nests built in trees. They only ate green 
leaves, which made their skin green.
“Well, you can’t just eat leaves,” Mrs.
May said. She fed the green 
girl home-cooked meals,

people had a huge

Albert Einstein
My name is Albert Einstein. Many people know about the great things I’ve 
accomplished. But I had many barriers before I became famous.
I was born in Germany. When I was in elementary school, I already knew 
about math and statistics. When I was a boy, I pretended to be a great scientist. 
I loved school, but my life at home was hard. My father lost his job, so my family 
lived in poverty. We could not pay the rent in Germany. We became immigrants 
and went to Italy. I finished high school and went to college in Switzerland.
After college, I began writing about science. I did not reach success in an 
instant, though. At first, other scientists did not approve of my work. They 
thought I was a failure. Rising to the rank of an admired scientist was a gradual 
process. Soon, people started to notice that I was right. At last, I began to get 
some recognition.
I showed how to find the approximate size of very big things, like stars. I also 
detected and explained the movement of very small things, like atoms. And
for fun, I made a machine that could 
refrigerate food by inserting 
heat. I never retired. It 
was my duty to keep 
working. I overcame 
many hard times, 
and I will be 
remembered 
for my 
important 
works.

The Two Captains
Once there were two ships. Both ships carried cotton. The captains were very 
different. Thomas was strict. He made his crew engage in difficult tasks. “Make 
sure the ship’s deck is firm and that nothing falls! Put more fuel in the tank!” he 
said. His ship was very plain, but he never had a problem with it.
The second captain, William, was not serious. He had a grand ship, and he 
loved having fun. His crew amused him by singing and dancing. But his crew 
never fixed anything on the ship. They just wanted to surf.
One day, Thomas saw a hurricane ahead. He knew that his ship needed to 
turn around. But he was sure William did not see the storm. He adjusted the 
dials on the radio and called his friend. Thomas said, “You’ll hit the reef. It’s 
made completely of coral. Turn around to ensure that you do not crash.”
William said, “We will go under the deck and shut the door. We will dance 
and sing until we are past the danger zone.”
When William’s ship got to the hurricane, the wind blew it into the reef. The 
ship crashed, and water flowed below the deck. William’s 
crew accused him of being 
a bad captain. The

The Fisherman
Every day, a fisherman sat on a bridge. He ate apples and spit the seeds 
into the water. He had a simple way to catch fish. He cut a branch off of a tree 
and tied a line to it. He put a sharp hook on it and made a tight knot. Then he 
whispered, “Come here fish.” Like magic, the fish bit the hook. He put them in a 
big net and took them home to make big pots of fish soup from them.
One day, another man walked up to him. He said, “My name is George. I am 
staying at the inn. I bet that I am a better fisherman than you. I will accompany 
you today. I dare you to prove your skill!” The fisherman cast his line.
George had a lot of electronic tools. One machine gave him the virtual 
locations offish. His rod weighed fish.
At the end of the day, George subtracted his fish from the fisherman’s. The 
fisherman had beaten him by forty-seven!

Osiris and the Nile
Long ago, Osiris was the king of Egypt, and Isis was the queen. They ruled 
the fertile land by the Nile River. They had great intelligence, and they shared 
their abstract ideas with everyone. Osiris taught the Egyptians how to make 
wheels and furniture. Isis taught them how to make things from clay and cloth. 
The people thought they deserved a gift. So they built Osiris and Isis a pyramid. 
Everyone loved Osiris except his brother, Set. Set wanted to be king.
Osiris made his annual trip around Egypt and led religious events. The 
villages gave him beautiful shells and colorful feathers as gifts.
When Osiris returned, Set brought a beautiful wooden box from behind a 
curtain.
“ If someone fits inside this box, I will give it to him or her,” Set said.
Osiris got in it. It was an ideal fit!
Suddenly, Set closed the box and threw it into the river. “ Now I will be king!” 
Set said.
The box washed up on a foreign shore after a flood. Isis brought his body 
home and obtained a grave for him in 
Egypt. The Egyptian gods thought Isis

The Taxi Driver
Peter’s job was driving a taxi downtown. He made a small salary. But he 
liked his job because it wasn’t dull. Every day, he saw new things that appealed 
to him. Peter was practical about the future. “Maybe I can get a scholarship to 
college,” he thought. “I could learn mathematical formulas and get a job at a 
bank. I could help clients invest their money.”
Peter stopped to pick up a passenger. “Where to?” he asked.
“Go to the Fourth Street Bank. And don’t talk to me. I’ve had a rough day,” 
the man said. Peter was angry, but he had a peaceful philosophy. When they 
stopped, the man’s fare came to $10.25. He put his hands in his pockets. “ I 
can’t find my wallet!” he said. “I can’t pay the fare!”
Peter said, “Maybe I’ll give you a temporary loan. You can borrow ten dollars 
and a quarter from me.”
The man was embarrassed, saying, “ I was mean to you, but now I want to 
help you. I founded this bank. I want to give you one thousand dollars.”
That much money was like a treasure to Peter. The man urged him to take the 
money, but he didn’t.
“You’re an honest person,” the man said. “I 
assumed you would take it. I want you to work for 
me.”
The next day, Peter started his job at the bank. 
He was happy to be done with his former job.
