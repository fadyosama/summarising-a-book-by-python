The History of Chocolate
Many people believe that chocolate originally came from Europe. However, chocolate, 
called the “food of the gods,” was first made in the Americas. The first chocolate was 
very different from contemporary chocolate.
Wild chocolate trees can grow easily in the humid Amazon rainforest. Clusters of 
flowers growing on these trees turn to seeds. About 20 to 60 cacao beans can be found 
in the seeds. Cacao beans are the ingredient needed to create sweet, soothing, and 
delicious chocolate treats.
The Mayan and Aztec cultures both thought that chocolate trees were brought from 
paradise by gods. The Mayans and Aztecs used the beans from this divine tree to create 
a special beverage with a very pleasant odor. Surprisingly, the Aztecs believed that it 
would be toxic to women and children.
In the 1500s, the Spanish explorer Cortes met the Aztecs. Cortes became quite 
interested in the plantations where the Aztecs cultivated chocolate trees. When he 
returned to Europe, he took cacao beans with him. He introduced the people of Spain to 
the Aztecs’ chocolate beverage.
Over the next 100 years or so, kings, queens, and members of the upper class 
enjoyed drinking chocolate. They enjoyed it even more once they learned to add sugar 
to the beverage! Soon, chocolate had spread all across Europe. New machines allowed 
chocolate makers to perfect their products and produce them at a very rapid rate.
Preparing the beans in special ways brought out the aroma of chocolate. The beans were 
combined with condensed milk to give the chocolate a smooth texture.
Today, contemporary chocolates with subtle flavors fill the shelves of expensive 
chocolate shops. The different types of chocolate 
available today vary widely. True chocolate 
lovers can tell which is best, though. They will 
tell you that the flavor of high quality 
chocolate stays on the palate long 
after you finish it.
A Mark each statement T for true or F for false. Rewrite the false
statements to make them true.

Monkey Island
In the middle of the ocean, there is a small island shaped like an arc. Here, monkeys 
play on the beach and in the trees. But how did the monkeys get there?
Once, an English admiral was exploring Africa when he found hundreds of monkeys. 
The admiral’s character was mean. He thought, “I could sell these monkeys and become 
very rich! I’m going to take them to England.”
So the admiral set traps to catch the monkeys. He put stakes in the ground, tied 
string around them and made loops in the string. When the monkeys ran through the 
forest, their feet got caught in the loops, and they couldn’t escape. Then the admiral put 
the monkeys in cages on his ship and sailed away.
The cages were small and uncomfortable. There was no soft hay for the monkeys to 
sleep on. Instead, they slept on branches with sharp thorns that cut into the monkeys’ 
flesh. For dinner, he gave them tiny pieces of sour grapefruit to eat. The monkeys grew 
hungry and weak.
But one day, the admiral hired a new steward. He was a kind man with a good 
conscience. He was horrified to see the thin monkeys in the cages. So one night he let 
them out.
The monkeys ran and played all over the ship! They attacked the admiral and the 
steward and ate their food. They completely wrecked the ship. One monkey ran into a 
kerosene lamp, and it fell over. The ship caught fire and began to sink! The whole crew 
was lost except for the monkeys.
After the accident, the monkeys jumped onto a raft. They floated away from the fiery
blaze of the ship. In the morning, they saw a little island in the distance. The monkeys
used a piece of wood as a paddle, and they 
went toward it. They found the
island shaped like an arc. They 
felt so happy to find a 
new home, and 
they still live 
there today.

The Young Man
and the Old Man
A proud young man was looking for a new pastime. He heard about people hiking in 
the national parks and decided to try it for himself. As he started his stroll, an old man 
walked up to him.
“Don’t go this way,” the old man said. “Beware. The paths are not clear. It’s easy to 
become lost.”
But the young man disagreed with the old man and bragged that he had a perfect
understanding of the park. “I studied maps of this area,” he told him. “I believe I have a 
thorough knowledge of these trails. I won’t become lost.”
The old man listened to the young man and then admonished him for his pride.
“I have walked these trails my entire life,” he said. “If you think you will be safe, then 
go ahead.”
The young man ignored the old man and started along the trail.
Whenever he had to choose between an easy or difficult route, he always chose the 
more difficult option. In addition, he was not conscious of which direction he was going. 
After a while, he decided to return home. Because his course through the wilderness was 
so indirect, he had no idea where he was.
He looked at his map but could not pinpoint his location. He walked one path after 
another but soon realized he was lost.
The sun was going down, and sudden strong winds gave a hint that it might rain. 
Immense clouds filled the sky. Awesome sounds of thunder were audible from all 
directions. It echoed off the mountains. The thought of the eventual storm tormented the 
young man. He hurried in one direction, but soon switched out of confusion. Luckily, it
led him out of the park.
When he arrived home, he knew that he had acted like 
an idiot. He realized he was lucky to be alive. He decided 
to listen to people with more experience than himself.

The Tricky Fox
There was a fox that lived in the forest. Fox loved to play mean tricks on the other 
animals. One day, he used the sharp rim of a bottle to dig a pit in the ground. He hid in a 
tree until Rabbit came to the pit’s edge. Then, he jumped out and pushed Rabbit into the 
pit. Fox laughed and ran away. The angry Rabbit climbed out and told the other animals 
what happened.
The others said, “That is typical behavior for Fox. He does mean things all the time. 
Sometimes, he is completely immoral. We all disapprove of his actions, so we should 
teach him a lesson. Tomorrow, we’ll push Fox into that pit.”
The next day, all of the animals hid near the pit and waited for Fox. Fox was oblivious
to the hidden animals. He walked up to the pit to see if Rabbit was still trapped. Just 
then, the other animals ran up to Fox and pushed him in. All the animals laughed and 
cheered, except Fox, of course.
Fox couldn’t get out! The walls of the pit were covered in damp ivy. It was too slippery
for him to climb out. He was utterly helpless. He moaned and began to weep.
At last, he saw Eagle watching him from her roost. He yelled, “Eagle, please help me! 
If I don’t get out of here, I will perish!”
Eagle said, “You may think your tricks are trivial, but you hurt others when you do 
mean things. I’ll help you if you promise to be nice.”
Fox said, “I promise!”
Eagle began her flight to the bottom of the pit. She picked up Fox with her beak and 
soared out of the pit. She dropped Fox safely on the ground.
Fox thanked Eagle and kept his promise. He was nice to the other animals. The

The Magic Computer
I had a difficult geography project to finish by the end of the semester. My teacher 
wanted it to be typewritten, so I went to the school computer room. But when I got 
there, all the computers were turned off. Apparently there was a recent problem, and 
technicians were fixing it.
I knew of some private study rooms downstairs. They were small and dark, and the 
computers were very old, but I had no choice. At least the computers were operating
correctly. I typed and highlighted the assignment’s title: “Evaluate the Government’s 
Response to Global Warming.” But I didn’t know what to write in my essay. Finally I 
decided to find a book to help me. I went to the library, checked the book indexes and 
eventually found a useful book. Then I returned to the computer.
When I looked at the screen, I saw something so weird that I nearly fainted! The essay 
was complete! Had somebody in cyberspace written it? I didn’t know, but I was very 
happy. I printed it out and handed it in. I got an “A.”
After that, I used the computer for all my assignments. I’d type the title, wait awhile, and 
the computer would do it. Every assignment was perfect; I never had to edit anything. I 
stopped paying attention to my teacher’s lectures and spent my extra time in the gymnasium.
And my grades got better and better.
A month later, I was walking into class when my friend said, “Are you prepared for the 
test?”
“What test?” I asked.
“The geography test!” he replied. “I hope you studied. It’s worth seventy percent of 
our final grade!”
I failed the test, of course. I was completely ignorant about the subject.
After that, I made a resolution never to use the magic computer 
again. The moral of this story is that if you cheat at 
school, you won’t learn anything.

Jack Frost and the Pudding
Every winter, a magical boy with a wild spirit named Jack Frost arrives in 
town. He wears a white cape, and his role is to cover everything with frost 
and ice. But Jack Frost also gets pleasure from playing tricks on common 
folks.
One dark winter evening, he was sitting on the rail of a fence near a 
river, pointing at some trees. When he did so, there was a pop, and 
the trees were evenly covered in frost.
Then old Tom Muggins came along the path. He was carrying 
a basket of ingredients for his wife’s cake recipe. “I’ll have some 
fun with him!” said Jack Frost. He pointed, and suddenly there was 
a patch of ice on the path. Poor Tom slipped and fell into the river.
The bags of flour, fruit and sugar fell open and got wet. A couple of 
eggs broke, and a stick of butter shrank in the water. Tom gathered the 
ingredients and climbed out of the river. The food made an absolute
mess of the path. “Alas!” he cried. “There’ll be no cake for me!”
Jack Frost laughed at poor Tom because his nice suit got soaked as 
well. “Are you cold?” he said. “Don’t worry, I’ll make you warm!” He 
pointed at the mess in Tom’s basket. Suddenly, there was a spark.
What was left of the food caught fire! Jack Frost ran off laughing.
Poor Tom sat by the fire. He could only envision how angry his 
wife would be. He wished he had been more attentive and noticed 
that Jack was around.
Suddenly, a pleasant smell came from the basket. Tom looked 
inside. The butter was melting and the eggs were starting to 
cook! Even the fruit began to simmer. Soon there was a fat, brown
pudding in the basket! Tom tasted it. It was delicious! He happily 
took it home for dessert. Although Jack Frost had tried to make 
Tom’s life difficult, Jack had actually made Tom a wonderful 
pudding!

The Architect’s Plan
An architect wanted to build a new office building.
He selected some land that seemed perfect. He 
planned to cut down the trees to make room for the 
building. But there was a problem . . . a big problem.
The land was actually the habitat of several types 
of birds. Some nature lovers were very upset with the 
architect. First, they held a rally and told others about 
the issue. Then, they decided to take legal action because 
the architect didn’t respect the animals’ rights.
To resolve the problem, they asked a judge to 
intervene.
The judge could not call any witnesses for the nature lovers, so he first asked 
the architect to tell his side of the story.
“Why are you going to destroy the birds’ habitat?” the judge asked.
The architect replied, “I have the deed to the land. I want to make a great 
building there. As you may know, all my buildings become memorable landmarks.”
Then one of the nature lovers spoke. “We believe that there’s no 
reason to destroy all the trees. We just want to protect the birds.”
Then the judge made his decision. “I proclaim that 
the office building should be built,” he said. “It is not 
a crime to remove those trees. I cannot give you a 
sentence for any offenses, but I feel obliged to 
make one request. I will only allow you to use 
half of the land. The other half will remain 
free, so the birds have a place to live.
The nature lovers could not conceal
their gratitude. All of the people cheered.
The architect said, “I have an idea.
I will volunteer my time and efforts to 
design a new type of building. It will 
provide bushes on the roof where birds 
can live. There are enough resources in 
my company’s bank account to create the 
best building ever made.”
The architect did exactly as he 
promised. He built this new type 
of building, which was loved by 
everyone.

Janie and the Music Player
Janie had constant thoughts about getting a music player. One day, she was late to 
class. She hurried down the hall but halted when she saw a backpack on the floor. She 
looked inside and found nothing but some books. She reached inside the bag and felt a 
small object at the bottom. It was a music player enclosed in a black case! Janie tended
to be honest, and she had no valid reason to take the device. However, her desire for 
the player influenced her decision. Janie was being sly. She put the device into her own 
backpack. When she arrived at class, she gave her teacher the bag. “I found this,” she 
said.
Ms. Johnson asked, “Does this backpack belong to anyone?” A girl named Linda 
claimed the bag. Linda looked inside and yelled, “My music player 
is missing! Janie took it!” Janie answered, “I did not.” Linda 
responded, “You were the only one that had access to it! If your 
version of the story is true, you’ll let Ms. Johnson check your bag.” 
Janie started to perspire as she realized the impending trouble 
she was in. She gripped her bag tightly.
Ms. Johnson took the bag from Janie. Inside 
she found the player. “Janie, I never expected 
this kind of conduct from you,” she said. “You’ve 
always been such a good student.”
Ms. Johnson gave Linda the player. Linda said, “Ms. 
Johnson, look!” There was a crack along one side. She 
turned it to the “on” mode, but it wouldn’t work. It must’ve 
snapped while Janie was holding onto the bag so tightly.
Ms. Johnson called Janie’s parents. They were very upset. 
“Stealing is illegal. You have no respect for the 
law whatsoever,” they said. “We bought you a 
music player, but we’re giving it to Linda. It 
will replace the one you broke.” In the end,
Janie’s bad behavior left herwith nothing 
at all.

in a car accident. Many bad things could have happened to George, but he was lucky.
He was sent to live alongside other children without parents. There were kind people to 
assist George and help him go forward with his life. However, he was a pessimistic and 
mean little boy.
George was often outraged. He told mean rumors about the other kids. He smashed
furniture and even slapped other boys. He defied anyone who tried to help him, and 
soon it was difficult for them to forgive him. But George did display a love for one thing.

nor the teachers, he was lively and happy when he played baseball.

hitter. He almost never missed the ball. The teacher thought that George looked majestic
when he played. When George hit the ball, it flew through the breeze as if it would never 
come down. In time, they began to talk about other things. They talked about George’s 
3 family and his dreams for the future. They developed a very good relationship.

stronger. Soon the other boys and even the teachers looked small and feeble next to him. 
Everyone thought that this heralded the 
start of a great baseball career.
When George got his first job as a 
baseball player, he gave most of his 
wages to the people who had helped

Anton’s Great Discovery
Anton Van Leeuwenhoek was a Dutch cloth merchant. His life began to change after 
he got his first microscope in 1653. It was a very simple microscope. It had a lens in an 
upright stand. It could make small things look large. It was handy for looking closely at 
cloth.
Soon, Anton felt a longing to build a more powerful microscope. He dreamed of 
using it to make an important scientific discovery. He wanted to become famous. Three 
decades later, he did.
For many years, Anton experimented with microscopes and lenses. Eventually he 
constructed a very powerful microscope. If he had sold the concept to others, it would 
have made him very rich. However, Anton refrained from surrendering his secret 
to anyone. Instead, he wanted to use it to become famous. So he used his secret 
microscope to study the natural world.
One day he was looking at saliva from his mouth with the microscope. In the saliva, 
he saw numerous tiny particles. Some of them were moving! He thought that the 
particles were tiny organisms. So he isolated them from each other and studied each
one carefully. Then he classified them into different categories. Some 
were round. Others were long and had tails. All were alive.
Anton was so excited. He knew he could become famous 
now. He was the first person to see these tiny organisms. So 
he drew diagrams of the organisms and sent them to a group 
of scientists in London. The scientists were sophisticated men 
who did not believe tiny, animate organisms could live in our 
mouths. Anton made a plea for them to come to Holland to 
see the organisms with their own eyes. The men took a ferry
to Holland and met Anton. They performed a careful review of 
his work, and they conceded that he had made a 
worthwhile discovery. Anton Van Leeuwenhoek 
had discovered bacteria. After decades of 
hard work, he had become famous.

How a Singer 
Helped Win the War
Sometimes famous people are vain. They only care about themselves. But Josephine 
Baker was an exception. In the 1930s and 1940s, Baker was one of the most famous 
women in France. She was a big part of the new jazz genre and culture and had a diverse
group of fans. The French people especially loved her. And she loved France. So when 
World War II started, she wanted to help the nation that had given her so much.
In 1940, armed German troops entered Paris. When this happened, some French 
people formed a secret alliance. It was called the French Resistance. The group worked 
for the defense of France. It helped the European and American armies fight the 
Germans.
Baker was an important member of the Resistance. She had three 
jobs. The first was to carry messages to and from other members.
The messages were written in code on her sheets 
of music. The second was to provide shelter and *• 
supply goods to Resistance members. It would have 
been dangerous if the Germans found them.
Baker’s third job was the most important. Baker held 
concerts for European politicians and army members.
She lured them in, promising an entertaining show.
She enchanted them with her singing and dancing 
and got lots of applause.
But Baker was L
A
always equipped
with a small 
notebook at these 
concerts. She listened 
for details about the war and wrote 
them down. Baker sorted the details and gave 
authoritative reports to the Resistance.
Some thought Baker’s fame would be an obstacle. The 
Germans knew who she was, but they didn’t think she was smart 
enough to work for the Resistance. So she could get information 
from the Germans easily. This helped the Resistance and the 
French army save lives and win the war.
Baker had a big impact on the Resistance’s work. She got 
many awards for her help. When she died, the army had a special 
ceremony to thank her again for her bravery.

The Sun and the North Wind

saying that he was better than everyone else. The Sun listened as the North Wind talked 
with enthusiasm about how powerful he was and how he could push something from 
one continent to another with one breath. He said, “I am the strongest thing in the sky.”
“Really?” asked the Sun. “How do you know that you are more powerful than the 
stars, or the rain, or even me?”
The North Wind laughed with disrespect. He yelled, “You? That’s a joke!”
This hurt the Sun. He was usually timid and did not want to cause conflict. Today he 
decided that he should teach the North Wind a lesson.
In the meantime, a man began walking along the avenue down on Earth. When the 
Sun looked down on the terrain below, he saw the man. He pointed down to the Earth 
and said, “Do you see that man walking below? I bet I can get his jacket off of him. Can 
you?”
“Of course!” the North Wind replied as he took a deep breath and filled his lungs 
with air. He used all of his muscles in his face and belly to blow winds at his target in 
succession.
The harsh air currents made the man cold. The man pulled his jacket more tightly 
around him. It did not come off. The Sun decided to rescue the man from the mischief
of the North Wind. He said, “May I try?” Then he sent down sunlight that made the man 
warm. The man leaned against a tree. He took off his jacket and enjoyed the nice 
weather.
“You are very powerful,” the Sun said to the North Wind, “but you use 
violence in your bid to appear strong. You should think of an alternative.
The strongest people don’t use force to get what they want.”

The Big Race
Alex woke up scared because of a nightmare. In it, he was running a race. Just before 
he reached the finish line, he fell. Alex thought that it was a subconscious way that his 
brain was trying to warn him about something. He was going to run in a race that day. 
Did the dream mean he was going to lose? He became irritable.
“Good morning,” said Alex’s mother. “I brewed some coffee and made you a special 
breakfast.” Alex didn’t want it. It had too much sugar. He needed something nutritious.
So he prepared a meal that contained a lot of protein to maximize his energy for the race. 
Then his father asked, “Do you want help packing your stuff?” “No,” replied Alex. He wanted 
to make sure that he had all of his equipment for the race.
Alex’s family got in their van and drove to the track. When they arrived, a boy ran toward 
Alex. “Can I have your autograph?” asked the boy. Alex had many fans. He usually charmed
everybody he spoke to. However, today Alex refused to give the boy his signature. He 
needed to think about his race.
He took his jump rope from his bag and started his usual workout. Maybe exercising 
would help him forget about the nightmare. “The race is about to start,” said the coach. 
Beads of sweat formed out of Alex’s sweat glands. All he could think about was his terrible 
dream. He thought it might be his destiny to become a loser. While he was thinking, he 
didn’t hear the horn that meant the race had started.
The runners zoomed toward the finish line. By the time Alex started, he lagged far 
behind everyone. He couldn’t run fast enough to catch up to the others. He had lost the 
race! He shouldn’t have let the nightmare affect him. He should have stayed focused on 
the race.

The Brothers and the Bread
Two brothers wanted to go outside and play. However, 
because the only bread in the house was stale, their 
mother told them they needed to bake fresh bread.
“I have to have the car repaired,” she said. “When I 
return, if the bread is ready, you can play.”
The brothers hurried to prepare the bread, but not 
carefully. They didn’t sift the flour. They were careless 
and sprinkled too much salt into the mixture. The dough needed 
to be soft and flexible, but the salt made it into a lump that was as hard as a 
brick.
The younger brother uttered a sigh. “Now we have to start again,” he said.
“No, we don’t,” the older brother replied. “I’ll fix it. I just need to make the dough flat 
again and add water to it.”
He decided to hit the ball of dough with his fist to make it flat. But he hit it so hard 
that it flew right off of the table and knocked over a glass, which shattered. The dough 
then crashed into the kitchen window’s shutters and crumbled. Luckily, the brothers 
were not injured, but they did make a huge mess.
A slight mistake now became a major problem. The brothers had ruined the kitchen. 
Just then their mother returned. She saw the mess and became 
flushed with anger.
“Now you can’t play,” she said. “Instead, you have to clean 
the kitchen. I want this kitchen to be so clean that it may 
sparkle!”
The brothers cleaned the floor and expressed their sorrow 
to their mother. Soon, they were reconciled. But there was no 
bread, and it was too late to play. They realized that 
trying to do something quickly often makes more 
work.

Laika, the Space Dog
One of the world’s most beloved space travelers was also the 
furriest. Laika was a little dog living on the streets of Moscow,
Russia. She matured on the streets because no one would give 
her a home. She had to learn how to live without eating much. She 
found ways to keep warm in a very cold climate. Scientists thought 
a tough dog like Laika would do well in a project they were putting 
together.
In a prior launch, Russia had put the first man-made object 
into space. Now, scientists wanted to see if a living thing 
could go to space. Although many 
facts about space had been learned, 
they weren’t enough to help send 
humans to space safely.
Laika and two other dogs were 
chosen to help scientists with 
their research. The animals were 
used in a variety of tests. In the 
end, though, only Laika would go 
to space. On November 3,1957 the 
Sputnik 2 spaceship was due to leave Earth.
Scientists carefully applied wires to Laika’s skin to measure her 
body’s reactions once she got into space. Laika also wore a special 
leash. Without it, she would float around in the spaceship. Soon 
after, Laika left the planet. Scientists on Earth awaited information 
from the ship.
But in the midst of so much excitement, something very sad 
happened. Scientists were able to tell that Laika was under a lot 
of stress. The trip confused and scared her. Laika’s entire ship 
had become as hot as a furnace. Scientists were powerless to 
help the dog in her misery. After about five hours, Laika died.
Some have complained that the little dog should never have 
been used in the mission. Scientists knew that she would 
not survive the trip. Laika was never buried, but a memorial 
has been established in Moscow. There are many songs and 
books about her, too. It seems that Laika became a hero to 
many people.

Gwen’s New Friends

basketball. The custom is to let you choose your own teams. However, we’re going to do 
things differently.”
The coach assigned each girl to a team. There were six girls per team. Gwen glimpsed
at her teammates. She didn’t know any of them. All of her friends were on the other teams. 
She couldn’t believe her misfortune.
“I feel sick. May I go to the nurse?” asked Gwen.

class. With a stern voice, the coach said, “No.”
Gwen was vehement. “I don’t know any of these girls! Let me play on another team. 
Please!” she pleaded.
“Gwen, don’t be disobedient. I don’t want to hear any more negative comments from 
you.”
Gwen had no choice. Then a girl smiled at her. “Hi, I’m Stephanie. I was in your English 
class last year,” she said. Gwen remembered her. “For the sake of the team, please try 
your best. I know you’re a good player,” said 
Stephanie.
When the game started, Gwen played 
as best as she could. She took a long shot.
The ball sailed through the air and went 
right through the hoop!
“That was awesome!” said one of 
her teammates. Later, Gwen fell with 
a loud thump.
“Are you OK?” asked her 
teammates. They were worried.
She had ripped her jeans. She 
had scraped her knee and had a 
small bruise.
Gwen told her teammates,
“My knee is fine, and I can 
stitch my pants later. Let’s keep 
playing!”
By the end of the game,
Gwen forgot altogether that

a lot of new friends, and they were a 
source of happiness for her for many

Kara Goes Camping
“Kara, would you like to go camping with my family?” asked Tracy. Kara had never been 
camping before, but she decided to go anyway. That weekend, they drove to Estes Park. 
When they arrived, Kara looked around. She felt so far from civilization.
After they set up the camp, they went for a walk. Tracy’s father, Mr. Grieves, showed 
them the native plants and animals. “Look,” he said, “that’s a fox’s den. Do you see that 
bunch of mushrooms next to it. Don’t touch them. They contain poison.” Kara was bored. 
She didn’t care about nature.
As the day went on, mighty clouds soon loomed in the distance. “It looks like stormy
weather,” said Tracy. “We should go back.” It suddnely began to rain. They used an umbrella 
to shield them from the rain. Back at the camp, they ate cold sandwiches for dinner and 
went to sleep.
By morning, the rain had stopped. It was a drastic change from the previous day’s weather. 
They folded their sleeping bags and put them in a box. Tracy closed the lid and told Kara, 
“Today will be fun, I promise!” Kara didn’t believe her. She missed her convenient life in 
the city. She was used to an urban lifestyle.
After breakfast, they went for a walk. The grass was covered with dew, and it gleamed 
in the sunlight. Finally, they reached a lake. Kara and Tracy waded into the water. The reeds
swayed in the wind, and a flock of birds flew above. Kara felt very peaceful.
That night, they made a fire. They sat around it while Mr. Grieves told scary stories. Kara 
had a lot of fun. Camping was a good way for friends to spend time together, she realized.
The next day, it was time for them to leave. She felt sad while they exited the park. 
She didn’t like camping at first, but she learned how fun it could be over the weekend.

The School Play
Peter was excited. Next week he was going to audition for the school play. Everybody 
knew he was a great actor. He was sure he would get the lead role.
Later, his friend Robby asked him, “Have you seen the script for the play?”
“Yes. The title is The Lost Glove—it’s a comic play,” replied Peter.
Robby said, “I want to play the part of the hermit because the hermit gets to talk with 
an accent!”
“I want the lead role of the barber. I didn’t know you liked acting. I thought you liked 
choir better,” said Peter.
“Acting is also a hobby of mine. Do you want to practice with me? The basement at my 
house is quiet. It’s perfect!” Robby replied.
“I don’t like practicing with others. It complicates the process for me,” said Peter.
Actually, Peter didn’t want to practice at all. The teacher would surely reserve the lead 
part for him. A few days later, Robby came to his house.
Robby said, “Do you want to practice the scene on the staircase? It’s the part where 
the migrant searches for a new job.”
Peter declined the invitation. “I can’t today. I need to do some errands.” Then he 
slammed the door. It was just an excuse. Peter didn’t want to help Robby.
On the day of auditions, Peter wore his lucky leather jacket. He always got the best 
part when he wore it. The teacher told him to begin, but his mind was blank. He couldn’t 
remember the lines!
A week later, the teacher put a list of the parts on the wall. Peter read the list, looking 
for his name. He was shocked by what he saw. He blinked his eyes and looked again. He 
didn’t get the lead part—Robby did! Peter pondered the situation and came to the idea 
that Robby justly received the part. He earned it by practicing. Next time, Peter would

Isaac’s First Plane Trip
Isaac’s family was going on vacation. He was excited about the trip except for one 
thing. He had never been on a plane before. He was scared that his plane would have a 
breakdown.
Isaac got onto the plane. He walked down the aisle until he found his seat. He sat 
down and connected the ends of his seat belt. After being idle for a few minutes, the 
pilot announced that they were ready to leave.
He looked out the window at the vivid colors of the sky. He began to feel scared. The 
girl sitting next to him said, “Hi, I’m Rachel! You look nervous, but you don’t need to be. 
Flying is fun!”
“I’m still a bit nervous,” Issac said, “and I’m getting hungry.”
“The food service will begin soon. Just lower the tray on the seat in front of you, and 
flip this switch. Then they’ll bring your dinner! Last time, they served chicken, peas, and 
a box of raisins,” Rachel explained.
Then the pilot notified the passengers of bad conditions in the atmosphere. “We’re 
tracking the weather: lightning, clouds, etc. The ride might get a bit rough,” he stated.
Suddenly, the plane started to shake. Isaac was badly afflicted by his fear. His stomach 
hurt, and he thought he might vomit. He couldn’t believe that he was in such an unfortunate
place. Finally, the shaking stopped. Isaac was still scared, but he tried to retain a good 
attitude.
“The first time I flew, the plane shook so bad that cargo started falling. My parents told 
me to listen to music and read a chapter in my book. It calmed me,” Rachel said.
Suddenly, the plane shook again. This time, Isaac followed Rachel’s advice. He put on 
headphones and took out a book by his favorite author. The book and the music helped 
Isaac feel better. After a while, he didn’t even notice the bad weather. The bad situation 
didn’t feel so bad after someone helped him.

The Betrayal
A king lived in a fort with his daughter, Clara. The king had founded a great empire, 
but his land was rife with enemies who wanted to take over the kingdom. Because there 
was so much civil unrest, the king told Clara not to trust anyone.
One day, Clara was walking outside when she saw a girl sweeping the path. Clara 
crossed the garden, and they started talking. The girl’s name was Susie. Clara felt sorry 
for Susie because she was very poor, and Clara gave her a bracelet. After that, Susie and 
Clara met every day.
Once, the King saw them talking. He told Clara, “Don’t talk to that girl. She could be 
an enemy.”
“You can’t distrust everyone,” commented Clara. “She is my sole friend. It’s OK to be 
friendly to people.”
The King said, “Don’t argue with me. Stay inside from now on, and talk to no one.”
Clara felt lonely in the fort. But one day she saw Susie outside. She wrote her a note 
with a map showing a secret entrance to the fort. Clara wrote: “Come at night, and we 
can talk together. Don’t show anybody this note.” She threw the note to Susie, and Susie 
tucked it in the lining of her dress.
That night Clara waited for Susie. But she heard something ticking, and then a loud 
blast. She ran into the hall, and it was full of smoke, which made her choke. A mass of 
soldiers were there, fighting. Clara realized that Susie had betrayed her and given the 
map to her father’s enemies. Clara prayed that everyone in the castle would be safe from 
her friend’s treachery.
At last, the fighting ceased. Clara found her father in the hall with his soldiers. They 
had defeated their enemies, but there were dents in their armor from the heavy fighting. 
Clara told her father what she had done and promised never to disobey him again.

The Teller and the Thieves
A teller at a bank suspected some of her fellow employees of not being very trustworthy.
She thought they were stealing. In order to catch them, though, she needed some way to 
link them to the crime.
She had a background in religion and folklore. She remembered that one religion’s 
literature had a myth that chronicled how a group of thieves was captured.
In the millennium-old story, coins of copper were covered with venom taken from a 
poisonous snake. The coins were left as bait for the robbers. When they touched the coins, 
the venom infected their bodies through their skin. The venom ran through their veins,
and they all became very sick as if they had a disease. It made their skin purple. The police 
arrested whoever had purple skin.
She knew she couldn’t use venom because it might 
hurt someone. However, she thought of a way to update
the old story. She decided to cover a sum of money with 
a special powder. If people touched the money, the 
powder would cause their skin to itch. She placed the 
stack of money in the bank’s safe. No one was supposed 
to take money from the safe. If somebody did, then they 
had to be stealing.
Within a few hours, three of her coworkers were 
scratching their hands and arms. They itched so badly 
that they couldn’t even work. She checked the money, 
and it was gone. She told her boss what she had done, 
and he had the thieves arrested. He thanked her and 
promoted her.
Because events from 
history often repeat, 
ancient 
literature 
had 
helped
_ the teller solve
a crime. She proved that 
stories from the past still relate with the problems of 
today, and they can be helpful in solving problems.

The Scribe’s Warning
A great and powerful empire needed the wood from its western areas to build palaces 
and homes forthe emperor and his friends. However, the empire had depleted many of the 
forests. The trees were important to the western areas’ economy. With no trees to sell, the 
commerce in that area was reduced. Citizens could no longer purchase the goods that they 
needed to survive. Their life became difficult.
A poor scribe from the area wanted to help. He hitchhiked to the capital to ask the 
emperor for charity. He was invited to the palace. It was large and cozy. Tables were loaded 
with food, and fires burned warmly in every fireplace.
The emperor sat up upon his throne, and the scribe stood in front of him.
“I’ve come to ask for help,” the scribe said. “We’re all very poor and hungry. You’ve 
used up all of the forests, and now we have nothing to sell.”
Then he added a warning. “If we don’t receive help, I’m 
afraid that the entire empire will suffer. We must 
establish some unity.”
Upon hearing the scribe’s request, the 
emperor’s bad temper surfaced. He mocked
the scribe. “You think I should help,” he said 
and laughed. “You should just be happy 
to belong to this great empire. You will get 
nothing from me.”
The emperor felt no pity for the citizens 
of the western area. They were condemned
to starve. The scribe returned home with 
nothing.
Not long after, an enemy invaded the 
empire from the west. They were marching 
to the capital. Because the citizens felt 
persecuted by the emperor, they remained 
neutral. They didn’t fight the invaders but 
allowed them to march freely to the capital.
The emperor was defeated. If he had 
heeded the words of the scribe, then the 
citizens might have been the victors. But 
because he had treated them badly, they 
treated him badly in return.

How the Dinosaurs Really Died
Many scientists and intellectuals think that dinosaurs 
died when an asteroid smashed into the Earth millions 
of years ago. However, recently, there has been some 
controversy over this theory. Some scientists think 
that it isn’t accurate. They think that a tiny insect may 
have been the biggest factor in the death of these 
huge creatures. That insect was the mosquito.
Ml - * These scientists do think that an asteroid hit the Earth
the time of the dinosaurs. But that wasn’t what killed all of them.
At that time, insects, including the mosquito, were beginning to evolve. Today, we can 
regulate the number of mosquitoes with pesticides. But that was impossible millions 
of years ago. The mosquitoes multiplied quickly. And they were certainly not idle. Since 
there were so many mosquitoes, it was easy for them to bite many of the dinosaurs. 
When they bit another living thing, the mosquitoes passed along a deadly disease. So the 
dinosaurs were stricken with the disease. A vast majority of them, from the vegetarians to 
the meat eaters, died.
To reinforce this idea, scientists stress how gradually the dinosaurs died. If an asteroid 
ifc*- • killed them, they would have died very quickly. But the number of dinosaurs decreased 
slowly. In addition, scientists have found genetic material of mosquitoes in fossils. This 
material proves that mosquitoes existed back then. Although there may have been other 
factors, the dinosaurs died mainly because of disease, the scientists say.
1, .1^.3# No matter how it happened, the dinosaurs’ death had a major impact on other living
things. Many dinosaurs ate mammals. After the dinosaurs died, mammals were able to 
> evolve and produce offspring. Birds also evolved. Scientists have analyzed the genomes of
birds, and they discovered 
that birds have identical
genetic material to some 
dinosaurs. So there may 
still be dinosaurs among 
us after all.

The Traveler and the Innkeeper
A traveler stopped at an inn. He sat and watched people closely, like a predator. He 
heard the old innkeeper talking to a young man in the core of the inn.
“I just need to borrow some money. I swear that I’ll spend it in moderation, and my 
friend will pay you back tomorrow,” the man said. The innkeeper gave his consent and 
pulled out some money.
The traveler knew that this was a trick. The man was going 
to leave with the poor innkeeper’s money and never return.
He felt compassion for the nice innkeeper and did not want 
him to be tricked. The cunning traveler decided to teach the 
innkeeper a lesson.
The traveler walked over to the innkeeper and sat down.
The innkeeper had started to grind coffee beans to make 
coffee. He made the coffee and handed the traveler a 
saucer and a cup. The two started talking. After a while the 
traveler yawned and then growled like a wolf.
“Are you not sane? I thought I just heard you growl,” 
said the innkeeper.
“I did. I am cursed. Every time I yawn three times in a row,
I turn into a wolf and attack people.”
The innkeeper became tense. Then the traveler yawned again. As the 
traveler started to yawn a third time, the innkeeper turned to run outside. As he 
ran, the traveler snatched his coat. The scared innkeeper staggered outside and tumbled
into the street.
The traveler followed him out because he did not want to withhold the truth any longer. 
He just wanted to foster happiness and restore the innkeeper’s emotional equilibrium.
The innkeeper was dizzy, and he stumbled. The traveler helped him stand up.
“That was a trick,” the traveler said as he 
returned the coat.
“Oh, good. I cherish this coat,” responded 
the innkeeper.
“Well, hopefully this will teach you that 
you shouldn’t believe every story that you 
hear.”

Gilbert and the Lizard
Eliza disliked Australia. Firstly, she’d had to spend twenty uncomfortable hours on 
an aircraft getting here. She wanted to go to the beach, but her husband was a zoology
professor and wanted to look for some interesting animals. So now she was traversing a 
swamp in the midday heat.
“Let me sit down, Gilbert. I’m not hardy like you,” she said, eventually.
They sat under a tree. There were lots of birds in that secluded, rural place, and they 
watched them flying overhead.
Then suddenly Gilbert saw something on a rock.
“That’s strange,” said Gilbert. “That looks like a Red 
Swamp Lizard, but I thought that species was extinct.” He 
carefully picked it up. “Yes, it is! I’m going to take it back to 
the Zoology Institute. They will be filled with so much 
jealousy when they see what I have found!”
“Are you sure we should take it from its home?” 
asked Eliza.
“Nonsense, many animals migrate. They’re used to changes,” said Gilbert.
“Hmm, I don’t agree with the principle of it,” said Eliza. “It isn’t ethical.” But Gilbert 
was decisive and took the lizard back to the hotel in the city. He thought that this find 
would make him a highly esteemed celebrity at the Zoology Institute.
For the next few days, Gilbert fed and nurtured the lizard. But the lizard wasn’t happy. 
It lost its beautiful red color and began to look ordinary. In fact, Gilbert started to wonder 
whether it was special at all. He went outside and found a common lizard on a piece of 
concrete. When he compared them, they looked exactly alike. The lizard was only red in 
the swamp!
Gilbert said to Eliza, “I’m going to return this lizard to the swamp. I’ve learned an 
important lesson. Home is where we are happiest. At home, we are special like the red 
lizard. We can never be so happy when we are away.”
“Good,” said Eliza. “So, can we go home now?”
2. Eliza was a professor of zoology.
3. Eliza was hardier than Gilbert.
4. The swamp was in a rural, secluded area.
5. Gilbert thought that the red lizard was an extinct species.
6. Gilbert nurtured the red lizard at the hotel.

Colonel Wilbur and his wife Mary were flying over the tropics in their private plane. But 
suddenly the engine caught fire. It was impossible to extinguish the fire, so they were forced 
to land in the forest.
“What are we going to do?” said Mary. “Can you fix the plane?”
Wilbur said, “That’s impossible. I am not a technician, and the plane is out of gasoline. 
We’ll have to find help.”
Wilbur and Mary walked through the forest. It was difficult to find a path through the 
trees. Mary even tore her dress on sharp thorns. Suddenly, they saw some huts and lots 
of miniature people, cooking and making weapons with flint.
“I’ll ask them for help,” said Wilbur.
“No! Don’t go! They are deformed!” said Mary. “They’ll harass us! They may have a 
contagious virus that will make us sick! We won’t know how to cure it. We’ll surely end 
up as corpses!”
Wilbur tried to persuade Mary to go to the forest people, but she refused to integrate
with them. She had the assumption that the small people were dangerous. “Let’s keep 
walking. We’re sure to find someone sooner or later.”
For three days, the couple searched, but they found no one who could help them in 
their crisis. It was uncomfortable, and they were hungry without any source of nutrition.
Plus, the forest was filled with dangerous beasts. Finally, Mary agreed to return to the 
forest people.
When Wilbur and Mary arrived at the village, the forest people immediately welcomed 
them. They gave them bread made from barely to eat and a place to sleep. The next day, 
the forest people led Wilbur and Mary through the trees, and they promptly arrived at a 
small town. From there, they took a bus to the city where they found 
an embassy.
Mary was sorry that she had not trusted the forest people 
sooner. She learned the value of not discriminating
against people who are different.

a Dying Forest
Rainforests provide much of the world’s oxygen supply. But the forests’ exotic trees 
and animals are being killed to make room for farmers and roads. People have been 
trying to conserve rainforests for years. But another type of forest—the cloud forest—is 
just as beneficial to humans. Cloud forests are also in danger of disappearing, but little 
is being done to save them.
These forests are located at the tops of mountains, generally near the equator. These 
humid, wooded mountaintops are mainly in 
African and Central and South American 
countries. They are called “cloud forests” 
because their height allows for the formation
of clouds among the trees.
Rainforests produce large amounts of 
oxygen. Cloud forests produce comparative
amounts of water. The trees in these forests pull
water out of the clouds. The moisture gathers on 
the leaves. When it drips, it is deposited into streams. The streams flow into towns at the 
bottom of the mountain. Then, it’s distributed to people. The yearly cumulative rainfall in 
these areas is 173-198 centimeters. Cloud forests can pull in up to 60 percent of that. 
This water is crucial to the plants and the people in the area. It helps them survive.
Cloud forests are also the birthplace of countless species of plants that can’t be found 
anywhere else. One small cloud forest has the capacity for as many types of plants as there 
are in all of Europe. There are so many, in fact, that scientists haven’t made a comprehensive
list of them yet.
These forests are being destroyed with increasing frequency. Trees are being cut down, 
and roads are being built in their place. Some people have an objective to get federal money 
to protect the forests. But they have had little success. Another strategy is to replace the 
destroyed plants. That, too, has been difficult because the plants 
are so unique. There’s plenty of work to be done, but 
saving the cloud forests is still a possibility.

Thucydides and 
the Plague of Athens
Thucydides was the world’s first historian. Presently, we get most of our knowledge 
about ancient Greece from his writing. But Thucydides didn’t just write about history, he 
lived through it. However, he almost didn’t survive one historical event: the Plague of 
Athens.
In 430 BCE, an army attacked the city of Athens, where Thucydides lived. Thousands 
of people hid from the army behind Athens’ large walls. The city became very crowded 
as the population expanded. Then a horrifying disease broke out. People summoned
doctors. But it was to no avail because no one understood how the disease spread.
It seemed random. They didn’t know that it was an organism. Instead, they defined
disease as a punishment from their gods. Thucydides was incredulous that gods caused 
the plague, but he explained why others believed it. There was an old, long verse which 
predicted the disease. To paraphrase it, the verse said the gods would send a disease 
during a war. As a result, large crowds gathered at shrines to ask the gods to stop the 
plague. But the situation only worsened because these people were so close to each 
other they became sick. That’s how they learned a fundamental lesson about the plague: 
it spread from person to person.
People wanted to leave the crowded city, but they dreaded what the army outside would 
do to them. At this time, Thucydides got sick, too. He quickly scribbled down notes because 
he thought he would soon die. His writing shows a stark contrast between people’s behavior 
before and during the plague. There were riots, and people ignored laws. They didn’t think 
they’d live long enough to be punished. Many sick people were left to die in solitude because 
no one wanted to be near them. The plague lingered for two years. But luckily, Thucydides 
survived. Without his writing, we would know much less about ancient Greece and the Plague 
of Athens.

The Solar Car Race
We live in a mobile society. But the cars we drive require too much gas, plus they pollute
the air. Eventually, the natural resources used to make gas will run out. So what happens 
then? Many people think solar-powered automobiles are the answer. To learn more about 
this type of transportation, teams from universities and corporate organizations gather in 
Australia every two years for a solar car race.
The race is called the World Solar Challenge. Candidates for this tournament must 
design their own cars. The teams keep all their plans confidential. They don’t interact with 
other teams because the race is very competitive. And these cars aren’t just enhanced
and modified versions of normal cars. They are completely different.
The cars only have room for one person and are very simple inside—they don’t even 
have a cushion for the driver to sit on. These cars are shorter and much more flat than 
normal cars. Most importantly, the cars incorporate solar panels onto the outside that lie 
parallel to each other. These panels are made from materials that take in light from the 
sun and turn it into electric energy. That’s how they move.
These cars race over 3,000 kilometers across the Australian territories. The drivers have 
to heed strict guidelines. They must stop at certain intervals to charge their batteries. And 
unlike normal race cars, they can’t go very fast. They have to drive at the normal speed 
limits. Although the drivers want to finish the race quickly, that is not the main goal. The 
objective is to see how well the cars work under normal driving conditions.
Because of the World Solar Challenge, a new era in car making and in driving is 
beginning. People may ridicule the solar cars because they look strange, but this is a 
phenomenon that isn’t going away. Using the technology from the vehicles, car makers 
will eventually create solar cars for the rest of us.

The Heirs
Martin, Paul and Tom were brothers. They were very different, but they were consistent
about two things. They couldn’t succeed in business, and they never agreed about 
anything. Martin was a hardworking farmer, growing organic vegetables and raising 
poultry. But he was disorganized and forgot to pay his bills. Paul owned a textile factory 
that produced clothes. He was organized, but he was greedy and took too much clothing. 
His wardrobe was filled with his own products. Tom was once a sergeant in the army. He 
ran a martial arts school, but his stance on discipline was too strong. He had almost no 
students.
One day, they received a telegraph saying that their father had died. They were heirs
to his old farm. They planned to sell it as soon as possible, so they went to see it even 
though there was a terrible storm. The house didn’t look great, but there was a lot of land. 
There was so much, in fact, that they could barely see its boundary.
Suddenly, the storm got worse. The sheer force of the wind almost knocked them 
over. Martin said, “Look, it’s a typhoon!” Paul said, “No, it’s a cyclone.” Tom said, “No, 
it’s a tornado!” They argued until Paul began to wail and said, “Whatever it is, it’s coming 
right at us! We’re doomed!” The three brothers scrambled inside the old house. Martin 
said, “If we survive, we must stop fighting. This farm could be great if we fixed it up. With 
my hard work, Paul’s organization and Tom’s discipline, we could run a great business
together!” The storm finally ended. And luckily, it didn’t wreck 
the farm.
“Just think,” Martin said, “it took the chaos of a typhoon 
to bring us together.” Paul replied, “You mean a cyclone 
brought us together.” Tom said, “Didn’t I tell you 
both that it was a tornado?” The brothers 
never agreed on what kind of storm it 
was, but by combining their skills, they 
started a successful farm.
